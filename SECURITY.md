## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Use a private channel instead:

1. GitHub Security Advisory ("Report a vulnerability") when available for this repository.
2. BOSF maintainer channels with a clear subject line such as `SECURITY: Moon Dance`.

For urgent campus safety concerns, contact Bergen Community College Office of Student Life or Public Safety immediately in addition to project maintainers.

Include as much detail as possible:

- Summary of the vulnerability.
- Affected component(s) and file/path references.
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept.
- Expected impact and potential severity.
- Any known mitigations or patch suggestions.
- Your preferred contact method for follow-up.

## Response Expectations

- Initial acknowledgment target: within 3 business days.
- Triage/update target: within 7 business days.
- Validated critical/high issues are prioritized for remediation.
- Fix timeline depends on severity, complexity, and maintainer availability, with a goal of shipping urgent fixes as quickly as feasible.

## Coordinated Disclosure

- Please keep reports private until a fix or mitigation is ready.
- After remediation, maintainers may publish a public advisory/changelog note.
- We can credit reporters unless anonymous reporting is requested.

## Responsible Testing

- Test only systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
- Avoid actions that expose private data or degrade service availability.
- Stop testing and report immediately if sensitive user data is accessed.

## Non-Security Reports

Use public issues for:

- Feature requests.
- General bugs without security impact.
- Documentation improvements.
